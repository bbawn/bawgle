## Description

A learning exercise from long ago.
Bawgle: word search game based on popular fave. http://bawgle-game.appspot.com

Web frontend uses Google App Engine. 
See https://developers.google.com/appengine/

## TODO:
* multi language
* reverse boggle (given words, construct grid)
* better UI (including phone-friendly layout and grid interaction)
* multi player

## BUGS:
* cafe doesn't match, need to equate e-with-accent to 'e'
